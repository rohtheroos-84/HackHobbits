Goal:
Detecting AI-Generated Deepfake Faces in Digital Media:

 The advancement of AI-generated synthetic media has lead to an highly realistic deepfake images and videos. This pose significant threat to digital security, misinformation spread, and online frauds. The traditional detection methods often struggle against new deepfake techniques, leading to demand for robust, scalable, and efficient deepfake detection systems that can identify the AI images and adapt to newer fakes.

The Solution we proposed and executed:
 To effectively identify AI-generated images, we propose a hybrid deep learning approach using Vision Transformers (ViTs), enhancing with high-frequency pattern extraction techniques.
